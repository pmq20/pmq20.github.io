Due to high simplicity and applicability, SL has been substantially applied in a variety of decision making in the area of cybersecurity, opinion models, trust models, and/or social network analysis. However, SL and its variants have exposed limitations in predicting uncertain opinions in real-world dynamic network data mainly in three-fold: (1) a lack of scalability to deal with a large-scale network; (2) limited capability to handle heterogeneous topological and temporal dependencies among node-level opinions; and (3) a high sensitivity with conflicting evidence that may generate counterintuitive opinions derived from the evidence. In this work, we proposed a novel deep learning (DL)-based dynamic opinion inference model while node-level opinions are still formalized based on SL meaning that an opinion has a dimension of uncertainty in addition to belief and disbelief in a binomial opinion (i.e., agree or disagree). The proposed DL-based dynamic opinion inference model overcomes the above three limitations by considering the following: (1) state-of-the-art DL techniques, such as the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and the Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), for modeling the topological and temporal heterogeneous dependency information of a given dynamic network; (2) modeling conflicting opinions based on robust statistics; and (3) a highly scalable inference algorithm to predict dynamic, uncertain opinions in a linear computation time. We validated the outperformance of our proposed DL-based algorithm (i.e., GCN-GRU-opinion model) via extensive comparative performance analysis based on a real-world dataset.}, keywords={belief networks;decision making;graph theory;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);network theory (graphs);probabilistic logic;sentiment analysis;dynamic uncertain opinions;binomial opinion;topological dependency information;temporal heterogeneous dependency information;belief models;network data;unknown opinions inference;opinions fusion;deep learning-based dynamic opinion inference model;SL;subjective logic;decision making;Uncertainty;Heuristic algorithms;Predictive models;Logic gates;Laplace equations;Computational modeling;Data models}, doi={10.1109/BigData.2018.8622252}, ISSN={}, month={Dec},}

      author = {Mirrazavi Salehian, Seyed Sina and Figueroa Fernandez,  Nadia Barbara and Billard, Aude},
      year = {2016},
      abstract = {Coordinated control strategies for multi-robot systems are  necessary for tasks that cannot be executed by a single  robot. This encompasses tasks where the workspace of the  robot is too small or where the load is too heavy for one  robot to handle. Using multiple robots makes the task  feasible by extending the workspace and/or increase the  payload of the overall robotic system. In this paper, we  consider two instances of such task: a co-worker scenario  in which a human hands over a large object to a robot;  intercepting a large flying object. The problem is made  difficult as the pick-up/intercept motions must take place  while the object is in motion and because the object's  motion is not deterministic. The challenge is then to adapt  the motion of the robotic arms in coordination with one  another and with the object. Determining the  pick-up/intercept point is done by taking into account the  workspace of the multi-arm system and is continuously  recomputed to adapt to change in the object's trajectory.  We propose a dynamical systems (DS) based control law to  generate autonomous and synchronized motions for a  multi-arm robot system in the task of reaching for a moving  object. We show theoretically that the resulting DS  coordinates the motion of the robots with each other and  with the object, while the system remains stable. We  validate our approach on a dual-arm robotic system and  demonstrate that it can re-synchronize and adapt the motion  of each arm in synchrony in a fraction of seconds, even  when the motion of the object is fast and not accurately  predictable.},

abstract="Deep residual networks have emerged as a family of extremely deep architectures showing compelling accuracy and nice convergence behaviors. In this paper, we analyze the propagation formulations behind the residual building blocks, which suggest that the forward and backward signals can be directly propagated from one block to any other block, when using identity mappings as the skip connections and after-addition activation. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which makes training easier and improves generalization. We report improved results using a 1001-layer ResNet on CIFAR-10 (4.62 {\%} error) and CIFAR-100, and a 200-layer ResNet on ImageNet.

title = "Graph convolutional networks with eigenpooling",
abstract = "Graph neural networks, which generalize deep neural network models to graph structured data, have attracted increasing attention in recent years. They usually learn node representations by transforming, propagating and aggregating node features and have been proven to improve the performance of many graph related tasks such as node classification and link prediction. To apply graph neural networks for the graph classification task, approaches to generate the graph representation from node representations are demanded. A common way is to globally combine the node representations. However, rich structural information is overlooked. Thus a hierarchical pooling procedure is desired to preserve the graph structure during the graph representation learning. There are some recent works on hierarchically learning graph representation analogous to the pooling step in conventional convolutional neural (CNN) networks. However, the local structural information is still largely neglected during the pooling process. In this paper, we introduce a pooling operator EigenPooling based on graph Fourier transform, which can utilize the node features and local structures during the pooling process. We then design pooling layers based on the pooling operator, which are further combined with traditional GCN convolutional layers to form a graph neural network framework EigenGCN for graph classification. Theoretical analysis is provided to understand EigenPooling from both local and global perspectives. Experimental results of the graph classification task on 6 commonly used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",
